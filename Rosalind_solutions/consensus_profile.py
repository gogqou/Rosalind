A matrix is a rectangular table of values divided into rows and columns. An $m \times n$ matrix has $m$ rows and $n$ columns. Given a matrix $A$, we write $A_{i, j}$ to indicate the value found at the intersection of row $i$ and column $j$.

Say that we have a collection of DNA strings, all having the same length $n$. Their profile matrix is a $4 \times n$ matrix $P$ in which $P_{1,j}$ represents the number of times that 'A' occurs in the $j$th position of one of the strings, $P_{2,j}$ represents the number of times that C occurs in the $j$th position, and so on (see below).

A consensus string $c$ is a string of length $n$ formed from our collection by taking the most common symbol at each position; the $j$th symbol of $c$ therefore corresponds to the symbol having the maximum value in the $j$-th column of the profile matrix. Of course, there may be more than one most common symbol, leading to multiple possible consensus strings.


test


Given: A collection of at most 10 DNA strings of equal length (at most 1 kbp) in FASTA format.

Return: A consensus string and profile matrix for the collection. (If several possible consensus strings exist, then you may return any one of them.)
